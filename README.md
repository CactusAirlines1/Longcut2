The "longcut" is a shortcut, but it isn't short. It was also made on a school ipad. My ipad has a lot of trouble using shortcuts now. 
The page linked in the release is where you get the shortcut. read the text and watch the video before you run it
Also if you look at the channel which the video on the webpage is on, there should be another video of me making the long cut. if there isnt then im probably still working on it.
there is totally not any secret options in the shortcut

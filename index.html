    <h2>Instructions for Changing the ID for the Website (Recommended to do this right away)</h2>
    <div class="instructions">
        <p>First, there's a comment right at the top, it has an arrow which points to a text box. That's where you want to put your id. 
        There is a list, look for the get item from list, it should be at index 1. Change it to 2. Then, run the shortcut. All this is 
        just to get a date so yeah. The date it will show might be a bit different than what it is actually supposed to be, usually by 
        a few hours. No big deal. It's not all that important, but it's a nice detail I guess. If you don't do this, then it will make 
        one which is your device name.</p>

        <p>Below will be a video showing the entire process. It doesn't take long. In the video, there is an additional action that 
        I put in so that I didn't have to clear the id that would be created, and this action is the stop the shortcut action, which 
        stops the shortcut from creating another id because it is before the web part. This action is not in the shortcut linked here (I removed it) <strong>Do not add this action in the shortcut. 
        It will not work.</strong></p>
    </div>
